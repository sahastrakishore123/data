        <div class="level3"><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <P>A switch is an electrical component that can "make" or "break" an electrical circuit, interrupting the current
                    or diverting it from one conductor to another.The mechanism of a switch removes or restores the conducting path in a circuit
                    when it is operated. It may be operated manually, for example, a light switch or a keyboard button, may be operated by a moving
                    object such as a door, or may be operated by some sensing element for pressure, temperature or flow. A switch will have one or more
                    sets of contacts, which may operate simultaneously, sequentially, or alternately. Switches in high-powered circuits must operate
                    rapidly to prevent destructive arcing, and may include special features to assist in rapidly interrupting a heavy current. Multiple forms
                    of actuators are used for operation by hand or to sense position, level, temperature or flow. Special types are used, for example, for
                    control of machinery, to reverse electric motors, or to sense liquid level. Many specialized forms exist. A common use is control of
                    lighting, where multiple switches may be wired into one circuit to allow convenient control of light fixtures.</P>
                <h2> DESCRIPTION </h2>
                <IMG src="kjhiuy.PNG" alt="ELECTRIC SWITCHES">
                    <P> The most familiar form of switch is a manually operated
                    electromechanical device with one or more sets of electrical contacts,
                    which are connected to external circuits. Each set of contacts can be
                    in one of two states: either "closed" meaning the contacts are
                    touching and electricity can flow between them, or "open", meaning
                    the contacts are separated and the switch is nonconducting. The
                    mechanism actuating the transition between these two states (open or
                    closed) are usually (there are other types of actions) either an
                    "alternate action" (flip the switch for continuous "on" or "off") or
                    "momentary" (push for "on" and release for "of") type. Switches may be operated by process variables such as
                    pressure, temperature, flow, current, voltage, and force, acting as
                    sensors in a process and used to automatically control a system. For
                    example, a thermostat is a temperature-operated switch used to control a heating process.An ideal switch would have no voltage drop when closed, and would have no limits on voltage or current rating. It would have zero
                    rise time and fall time during state changes, and would change state without "bouncing" between on and off positions.</P>   
                 
                <h2>CONTACTS</h2>
                <P> a switch has two conductive pieces, often metal, called contacts, connected to an
                        external circuit, that touch to complete (make) the circuit, and separate to open (break) the circuit. The
                        contact material is chosen for its resistance to corrosion, because most metals form insulating oxides that
                        would prevent the switch from working. Contact materials are also chosen on the basis of electrical
                        conductivity, hardness (resistance to abrasive wear), mechanical strength, low cost,low toxity.</P>
